CAMB is a cosmology code for calculating cosmological observables, including
CMB, lensing, source count and 21cm angular power spectra, matter power spectra, transfer functions
and background evolution. The code is in Python, with numerical code implemented in fast modern Fortran.

See the `CAMB python example notebook <https://camb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/CAMBdemo.html>`_ for a
quick introduction to how to use the CAMB Python package.
