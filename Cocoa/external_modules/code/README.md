# Cocoa - The [Cobaya](https://github.com/CobayaSampler)-[CosmoLike](https://github.com/CosmoLike) Joint Architecture

# Overview

**The [Cobaya-External-Code](https://github.com/CosmoLike/cobaya_code) repository contains external Theory, sampler and likelihood codes**, such as [CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB), [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public), and [Polychord](https://github.com/PolyChord/PolyChordLite), and [CosmoLike](https://github.com/CosmoLike). This repository does require [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) and libraries that can uncompress files in the [xz file format](https://tukaani.org/xz/format.html), as some files associated with the Planck likelihood code are compressed. 

### Do not clone the Cobaya-Code repository explicitly; this is a submodule of [Cocoa's main repo](https://github.com/CosmoLike/cocoa).
